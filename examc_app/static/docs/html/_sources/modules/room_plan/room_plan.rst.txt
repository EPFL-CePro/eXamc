Seating map
=============

The seating map is a visual representation of the room layout. It shows the position of each student in the room.

This application (This server is accessible only by VPN) is used to create your seating plan based on the room and the number of students. There are several options that can be applied.

This web app is under development, please contact lucile.pinard@epfl.ch for any question

Options:
----------
Numbering option:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are two options that can be used, continuous or special. Continuous is the normal way to fill the room. The special option is used to create a room with special numbers (like A12, 24, E, ...). It will fill a room with the numbers that are in the CSV file. The CSV file must be created with one number per line.

Skipping option:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The skip option is used to skip some numbers. A CSV file is uploaded with one number per line, and the program will skip these numbers without leaving space in the room plan. With the same file, it is possible to create a room plan with the special numbers.

To use the "skipping option", please check the "fill all seat" button and put the number one in the "first seat number".

Fill all seats:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Fill All Seats option will fill all the seats in the selected rooms. It starts from the first written seat number.

Special file:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The special file entry is activated when the special or skip options are selected. A CSV file containing the extra numbers.

To use "special file" option, please check the "fill all seat" button and put the number one in the "first seat number".
